The :nth-of-type(an+b) pseudo-class notation represents an element that has an+b-1 siblings with the same expanded element name before it in the document tree, for a given zero or positive integer value of n, and has a parent element. In other words, this matches the bth child of that type after all the children of that type have been split into groups of a elements each. See :nth-child() pseudo-class for the syntax of its argument. It also accepts the 'even' and 'odd' values.
