<h1>::first-line e first-letter</h1>


<p>
A pseudo-element is made of two colons (::) followed by the name of the pseudo-element. <br />
Pseudo-elements create abstractions about the document tree beyond those specified by the document language. For instance, document languages do not offer mechanisms to access the first letter or first line of an element's content. Pseudo-elements allow designers to refer to this otherwise inaccessible information. Pseudo-elements may also provide designers a way to refer to content that does not exist in the source document (e.g., the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements give access to generated content).
</p>


<div>
The ::first-letter pseudo-element represents the first letter of the first line of a block, if it is not preceded by any other content (such as images or inline tables) on its line. The ::first-letter pseudo-element may be used for "initial caps" and "drop caps", which are common typographical effects. This type of initial letter is similar to an inline-level element if its 'float' property is 'none'; otherwise, it is similar to a floated element. <br />
